Big Mart Sales Prediction
Performed analysis on the dataset followed by predictions of the sales in amount in Big Mart depending on various features.
Analysis performed using numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries. It is a regression problem solved using various supervised machine learning models in scikit learn and performance of the algorithms is compared.
